# Helm Upgrade Command with Workarounds for Immutable Fields

# Use this command to upgrade the Helm release
helm upgrade --install loyalty-platform-v1 ./loyalty-platform-v1 -n loyalty-platform --force

# Alternative approach if the above doesn't work
# This will delete the PostgreSQL StatefulSet first and then perform the upgrade
# Note: This might cause data loss if not handled properly
# kubectl delete statefulset loyalty-platform-v1-postgresql -n loyalty-platform --cascade=orphan
# helm upgrade --install loyalty-platform-v1 ./loyalty-platform-v1 -n loyalty-platform

# For production environments, consider backing up data before performing these operations
